When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  To back up your work to remote location, also when collaborating on projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	The same control that you would want for logical seperation of commits from
        working locally you would want for remote as well. Plus you do not want Github 
	interfering with your code.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A fork is like a clone from one Github repo to another. A clone is an actually 
	copy of a branch either local or from remote to local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can see all the changes you have made or added that differ from you last pull. You can branch out the origin/master from your master to keep up to date.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

??? It would be very difficult too. Painfully

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	A good time to make changes in a seperate branch is when you would like create pull request.
